# Peer review 🧐

You have been assigned to review another group's project. 

## Step 1: Initiate review request (as a team)

* Open an issue in [`UBC-MDS/data-analysis-review-2025`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/data-analysis-review-2025.git) repository
* Fill in the issue template with required information
* Do this before (or at the beginning of) the lab
* Find reviewer assignments [here](https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/lab-sections/blob/main/peer_review_block3_2025-26.csv)

## Step 2: Reviewing (individual)

* View your assigned project number [here](https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/lab-sections/blob/main/peer_review_block3_2025-26.csv)
* Use the [MDS data analysis checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/data-analysis-review-checklist/main/data-analysis-review-checklist.md)

## How to give review feedback?

* Check all boxes in the template
* Provide **at least 3 pieces** of constructive feedback
* Include **at least 2 unique points** (some overlap with others is OK)
* Encourage discussion in the issue comments

## How to give good review feedback?

* **Be concrete**: Support claims with evidence and examples
* **Be empathetic**: Think about what feedback would help you if you are in their shoes
* **Be constructive**: Build on strengths, avoid judgmental language (sandwich style: good, bad, good)
* **Be kind**: Would you say this face-to-face to a dear friend?

"How we treat others is a reflection of how we were treated in the past, but also how we treat ourselves." 

It's ok to make mistakes. That's why you are hear. Mistakes are inevitable when you are growing and learning.

# Teamwork reflection 🤝

* After the course ends, we will run a script to calculate everyone's contribution to the team based on commit history
* We will also read through all your teamwork reflections
* Grade multiplier will be applied if needed

## Reflect on your teamwork experience

::: {.smaller style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.incremental}
* After you submit Milestone 4 on Saturday, take some time to rest, have a cut of tea ☕️, have a nice sleep 💤
* Next day, reflect on your teamwork experience in the past 4 weeks. 
    * What went well?
    * What could be improved?
    * What did you learn from your teammates?
    * What did your teammates learn from you?
    * Are you happy with how much you contributed to the team?

* You will reflect the performance of both **yourself** and **your teammates**.

## Tips

::: {.smaller style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
* Makefile
    * Well organized, documented
    * Has both "all" and "clean" targets. "clean" should wipe all artifacts
* Functions
    * Each function should only do 1 thing
    * Well organized, documented, consistent documentation style, meaningful function names
    * Your function should check if input is as expected and raise errors if not
    * Your function should return an object, unless it is intended to be used for side effects
:::
## Tips

* Tests
    * All tests should pass
    * Please include your test package in your docker image
    * Test needs to test for: 
        * Expected input
        * Edge cases
        * Error handling

# Good luck with your final project! 🦦
