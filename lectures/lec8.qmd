## iClicker: How do you verify your code is working as expected?

**A.** I stare at it really hard and hope my eyes don't deceive me! 👀

**B.** I share it with my mentor/supervisor/peer and see if they catch any bugs! 🤝

**C.** I run it once on a small dataset, if it doesn't crash, we're good! 🎲

**D.** I write unit tests like a responsible adult (boring but effective) ✅

**E.** I pray for the best! 🙏

# 🧹 Clean up your computataional environment!

## 🫧 Clean up your conda environments

1. Check all the conda environments you have created.

```{bash}
conda env list
```

2. Remove the environment you are not using anymore.

```{bash}
conda env remove --name <env_name>
```

## 🐳 Clean up your docker containers: Command line

1. Check all the docker containers you have created.

```{bash}
docker ps -a
```

2. Remove the container you are not using anymore.

⚠️ **Tip**:You may have containers that are still running, and not stopped properly. You need to stop the container before removing it.
